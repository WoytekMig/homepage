Probably the 'disappearing navigation' is something I'm proud of the most. This came to my mind after discovering 'sticky' option. It was nice but it covered up the header at the end. That's why I decided to hide it, untill you use your mouse ðŸ˜‰ It was't so easy, because I needed to avoid the move made by JS from 'link'... I 'tricked the system' by using timeout function ðŸ˜Š If you know how to improve it -- I will be greatefull for feedback ðŸ˜‰

### _Well, I can only have hope, that this homepage is just a beggining of a new, great story... ;)_
